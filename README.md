# Project Oz
A Question Answering Information Retrieval System
SUTD's 50.045 Information Retrieval Module Project

Project Oz aims to implement a span extraction information retrieval system for question
answering using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Our implementation of
Okapi-BM25 outperformed other extractive models like vector space model and language model.
Project Ozâ€™s end to end span extraction pipeline clearly demonstrated ability to extract exact
answers for a given query.

# Getting Started
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Load SQuAD dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
datasets = load_dataset("squad_v2")
```

# How to run the models
To run extractive models, uncomment desired models and run 
```
runner.py
```

To evaluate extractive model, uncomment desired models and run
```
extraction_evaluation.py
```

To use end to end span extraction model, run
```
end2end.py
```
